  abstract=     {When searching code developers may express additional constraints (e.g., functional constraints and nonfunctional constraints) on the implementations of desired functionalities in the queries. Existing code search tools treat the queries as a whole and ignore the different implications of different parts of the queries. Moreover, these tools usually return a ranked list of candidate code snippets without any explanations. Therefore, the developers often find it hard to choose the desired results and build confidence on them. In this paper, we conduct a developer survey to better understand and address these issues and induct some insights from the survey results. Based on the insights, we propose XCoS, an explainable code search approach based on query scoping and knowledge graph. XCoS extracts a background knowledge graph from general knowledge bases like Wikidata and Wikipedia. Given a code search query, XCoS identifies different parts (i.e., functionalities, functional constraints, nonfunctional constraints) from it and use the expressions of functionalities and functional constraints to search the codebase. It then links both the query and the candidate code snippets to the concepts in the background knowledge graph and generates explanations based on the association paths between these two parts of concepts together with relevant descriptions. XCoS uses an interactive user interface that allows the user to better understand the associations between candidate code snippets and the query from different aspects and choose the desired results. Our evaluation shows that the quality of the extracted background knowledge and the concept linkings in codebase is generally high. Furthermore, the generated explanations are considered complete, concise, and readable and the approach can help developers find the desired code snippets more accurately and confidently.},

  abstract={Fixing crashes is challenging, and developers often discuss their encountered crashes and refer to similar crashes and solutions on online Q&A forums (e.g., Stack Overflow). However, a crash often involves very complex contexts, which includes different contextual elements, e.g., purposes, environments, code, and crash traces. Existing crash solution recommendation or general solution recommendation techniques only use an incomplete context or treat the entire context as pure texts to search relevant solutions for a given crash, resulting in inaccurate recommendation results. In this work, we propose a novel crash solution knowledge graph (KG) to summarize the complete crash context and its solution with a graph-structured representation. To construct the crash solution KG automatically, we propose to leverage prompt learning to construct the KG from SO threads with a small set of labeled data. Based on the constructed KG, we further propose a novel KG-based crash solution recommendation technique KG4CraSolver, which precisely finds the relevant SO thread for an encountered crash by finely analyzing and matching the complete crash context based on the crash solution KG. The evaluation results show that the constructed KG is of high quality and KG4CraSolver outperforms baselines in terms of all metrics (e.g., 13.4%-113.4% MRR improvements). Moreover, we perform a user study and find that KG4CraSolver helps participants find crash solutions 34.4% faster and 63.3% more accurately.},

  abstract={Library migration, which replaces the current library with a different one to retain the same software behavior, is common in software evolution. An essential part of this is finding an analogous API for the desired functionality. However, due to the multitude of libraries/APIs, manually finding such an API is time-consuming and error-prone. Researchers created automated analogical API recommendation techniques, notably documentation-based methods. Despite potential, these methods have limitations, e.g., incomplete semantic understanding in documentation and scalability issues. In this study, we present KGE4AR, a novel documentation-based approach using knowledge graph (KG) embedding for recommending analogical APIs during library migration. KGE4AR introduces a unified API KG to comprehensively represent documentation knowledge, capturing high-level semantics. It further embeds this unified API KG into vectors for efficient, scalable similarity calculation. We assess KGE4AR with 35,773 Java libraries in two scenarios, with and without target libraries. KGE4AR notably outperforms state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., 47.1%-143.0% and 11.7%-80.6% MRR improvements), showcasing scalability with growing library counts.},

  abstract     ={Developers often ask how-to questions using search engines, technical Q&A communities, and interactive Q&A systems to seek help for specific programming tasks. However, they often do not formulate the questions in a specific way, making it hard for the systems to return the best answers. We propose an approach (TaskKG4Q) that interactively helps developers formulate a programming related how-to question. TaskKG4Q is using a programming task knowledge graph (task KG in short) mined from Stack Overflow questions, which provides a hierarchical conceptual structure for tasks in terms of [actions], [objects], and [constraints]. An empirical evaluation of the intrinsic quality of the task KG revealed that 75.0% of the annotated questions in the task KG are correct. The comparison between TaskKG4Q and two baselines revealed that TaskKG4Q can help developers formulate more specific how-to questions. More so, an empirical study with novice programmers revealed that they write more effective questions for finding answers to their programming tasks on Stack Overflow.},

                 abstract ={Developers often rely on API documentation to learn API directives, i.e., constraints and guidelines related to API usage. Failing to follow API directives may cause defects or improper implementations. Since there are no industry-wide standards on how to document API directives, they take many forms and are often hard to understand by developers or challenging to parse with tools. In this paper, we propose a learning based approach for extracting first-order logic representations of API directives (FOL directives for short). The approach, called LEADFOL, uses a joint learning method to extract atomic formulas by identifying the predicates and arguments involved in directive sentences, and recognizes the logical relations between atomic formulas, by parsing the sentence structures. It then parses the arguments and uses a learning based method to link API references to their corresponding API elements. Finally, it groups the formulas of the same class or method together and transforms them into conjunctive normal form. Our evaluation shows that LEADFOL can accurately extract more FOL directives than a state-of-the-art approach and that the extracted FOL directives are useful in supporting code reviews.},
