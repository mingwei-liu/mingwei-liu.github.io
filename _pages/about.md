Dr. Mingwei Liu (刘名威) is presently serving as an Associate Professor at the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, China.
Before joining Sun Yat-Sen University, he completed his postdoctoral research at Fudan University in 2024.
He received his Ph.D. and B.E. degrees in Software Engineering from Fudan University in 2022 and 2017, respectively.
During his academic tenure, he had the invaluable opportunity to work under the guidance and mentorship of [Xin Peng](https://cspengxin.github.io/).

Dr. Liu's research focuses on the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically in the domains of AI4SE and SE4AI.
His primary interest lies in leveraging advanced AI technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), to address software engineering challenges and tackle the software engineering and system engineering problems prevalent in AI applications and scenarios.
Dr. Liu has published over twenty papers in top international journals and conferences in the field of software engineering, such as TSE, TOSEM, ICSE, FSE, and ASE. He has received several prestigious awards, including the IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper Award (ICSME 2018) and the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award (FSE 2023).
